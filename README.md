Social Media Ostracism
===========

This is an interactive experimental paradigm, designed to manipulate feelings of social exclusion (ostracism) 
in an environment resembling a social media platform.

The original paradigm (2015) was designed by Ana Levordashka, Wouter Wolf, 
Johanna Ruff, and Steven Kraaijeveld (VU University), under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Kip Williams 
(Purdue University).

This version adopts a modification from Sarah Lutz and Frank Schneider (2021), which adds a social rejection condition.
